            What is Garri?
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            Garri, pronounced gah-ree, is made from granulated cassava, a root vegetable that’s poisonous unless you peel and cook it first. Commonly found in West Africa, there are two types of garri: yellow and white. The flavor depends on how long it’s been fermented and the presence of palm oil.

        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            Originally native to South America, cassava was introduced to West Africa in the 16th century by Portuguese colonizers. Garri became popular in Nigeria in the 19th century after formerly enslaved people began to return from Portugal and introduced a method for processing cassava. Today, garri is found in homes throughout the country, and, because it’s typically affordable and rich in fiber, and contains important trace minerals, has been described by many as a lifesaver when times are lean. When I was a student living in Lagos, garri was a means to an end for me and my classmates, there to fuel us while we studied for exams in the middle of the night or early morning. It has also served as the go-to food for me whenever I come home tired and hungry, with no strength whatsoever to prepare anything.

            How is it made?

            <div class="container" style="font-size: 20px;">
                Garri can be served hot and savory, cold and sweet, or as a creamy chilled pastry. On its own, it doesn’t have much flavor, so how you prepare it makes all the difference.

                        <li style="font-size:20px;"> A splash of milk can be added, and something for texture, like peanuts, groundnuts, or broken-up biscuits.</li>
